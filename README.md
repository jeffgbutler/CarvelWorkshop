# Carvel Workshop

Understanding the Carvel tools is fundamental to success with Tanzu. But it's not just for Tanzu. The Carvel
tools are small composable tools that can be used to improve any workflow involving YAML or Kubernetes.
Most of the Carvel tools are command line tools that do
relatively simple things. Together, they fill in a lot missing pieces in a Kubernetes workflow.

Some Carvel tools are installed into Kubernetes clusters as controllers. In fact, the definition of a "Tanzu" cluster
is just a plain old Kubernetes cluster with two specific Carvel tools installed: the secretgen-controller and the kapp-controller.

For some historical context, the Carvel tools were previously called simply "Kubernetes Tools" which was shortened to "k14s" in
true Kubernetes fashion. "k14s" was rebranded as "Carvel" when the project was sponsored by VMware - but you will still see
`k14s.io` used in several annotations generated by the Carvel tools.

In October 2022, VMware donated Carvel to the CNCF where it now resides as an incubating project.

Carvel is open source and you can read all about it here: https://carvel.dev/. The main source code repository is https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel

## Pre-Requisites

The full Carvel suite includes command line tools as well as controllers installed in a Kubernetes cluster. Virtually any Kubernetes cluster
can be used.

Before proceeding, please make sure you have installed the tools, and have access to a properly configured Kubernetes cluster. Instructions
for doing so are here: [Install Pre-Requisites](00-PreRequisites/README.md)


## Workshop Topics

The following pages have overviews and examples of several Carvel tools. You can view them in any order, but you should
have a good understanding of ytt, kbld, and kapp before reading about the kapp-controller.

- [secretgen-controller](secretgen-controller/README.md)
- [ytt](ytt/README.md)
- [kbld](kbld/README.md)
- [kapp](kapp/README.md)
- [kapp-controller](kapp-controller/README.md)
